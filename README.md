**Machine Learning Approach For Crop Yield Prediction**

Problem Statement
Predicting the crop yield based on parameters like temperature, rainfall and other soil features (pH, N, P, K etc.) using machine learning approaches.

Motivation
1. Agriculture is one of the most important occupation practiced in our country people. 
2. The Crop yield has a direct impact on National and International economies annually.
3. Due to  financial loss many farmers are committing suicide.
4. Modernization of agriculture is very important and will lead the farmers of our country towards profit.

Objectives
• To develop a model by considering various parameters like temperature, rainfall,
PH value, nitrogen, potassium, iron, zinc etc.
• To use Machine Learning algorithms to classify and predict the crop yield.
• To test the developed model in real time.

Methodology

Step 1: Collection Data - This is the first step in the Crop yield prediction process, where we collect agriculture data. We   have collected the datasets for the crop Paddy and Ragi from agriculture department for the region Mysuru.
Step 2: Data Preparation - Agriculture data is analyzed and only relevant data are extracted. We have used binning method for preprocessing.
Step 3: Features - Agriculture parameters used for crop yield prediction are fetched.
Step 4: ML Algorithms - In Supervised learning, you train the machine using data which is well labelled. We use Supervised Learning algorithm such as the Naive Bayes Algorithm for crop yield prediction. 
Step 5: Final Result - Crop yield is displayed for the farmers on GUI.
